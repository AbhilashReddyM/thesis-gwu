## GWU Thesis

This is a GWU SEAS thesis template. 
It complies with the requirements as laid out by the [ETD](http://library.gwu.edu/etd/formatting-content).

This is an extension/modification of a template created for the [University of Michigan](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dalle/codes/thesis-umich/) by Derek Dalle.
I've made some modifications and updates to replace out of date packages, and comply with GWU guidelines.

## Usage

This is still in development so it's prone to breakage/issues at any time.
