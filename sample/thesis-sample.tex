% Preface
\preface[4]{ %
This template demonstrates much of the use of the class file.
}

\prologue[5]{
Much of the code in this template is unchanged from the original version.
I have corrected several uses of obsolete packages, i.e., \texttt{subfigure}, \texttt{centerline} etc.
In addition, I've made some modifications to better match the GWU SEAS template.
}

\foreword[6]{
  The template provided by GWU,\url{http://library.gwu.edu/etd/LaTeX}, is severely lacking.
  In my opinion, it suffers from a number of deficiencies, including but not limited to:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item No actual source code, but rather a PDF printout of the source file
    \item Hardcoded values instead of a robust template/class file
    \item No guidance on the actual format (margins, text size, front matter, etc.)
  \end{enumerate}
This template is an attempt to remedy these problems and offer a consistent style for all future GWU graduate work.
