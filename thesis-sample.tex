This dissertation is in honor of Adlai Stevenson and William Jennings Bryan,
who were both twice the Democratic nominee for President of the United States
without winning either time.  As an interesting side note, Adlai Stevenson's
grandfather, Adlai E. Stevenson I, was William Jennings Bryan's
running mate in the 1900 election.}

% Preface
\preface{ %
The text of this document is of course mainly meant to show how
the template works.  The topic is thus a basic problem which has
been solved in a large number of ways.  This sample topic, which
is solving equations of one variable using iterative techniques,
allows us to use sample equations and figures so that we can see
how they will look in this template.  In addition to the standard
methods, the text also demonstrates a new algorithm that has
slightly improved performance.}

\chapter{Introduction}   \label{chap:intro}
The first part.  For example in \ac{CFD}.

\newpage

And this should at least continue onto a second page.  There are many texts that have a section on the subject, for instance \cite{chapra:2002:numerics}.

\chapter{Setting}
The second chapter has the good stuff.

\section{Convergence Criteria}
Actually, it might have the worst stuff.  But it is slightly easier to write than the material in Chapter \ref{chap:intro}.

\newpage

It takes very little text to fill a page in this format, but there is even less text on most of these sample pages.

\section{Why we are doing it}
It is usually a good idea to give reasons for your research.  If you do not, the people who payed you to waist all that time will feel really bad about it, and then they will not provide the same opportunity to future students.

\newpage

I need this page to see what even-numbered pages look like.

\appendix
\chapter{Methods}
Here is how to implement the methods.

\section{Bisection}
The easiest method.

\section{False Position}
The next one.
