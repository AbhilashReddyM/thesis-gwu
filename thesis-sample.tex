This dissertation is in honor of Adlai Stevenson and William Jennings
Bryan, who were both twice the Democratic nominee for President of the
United States without winning either time.  As an interesting side note,
Adlai Stevenson's grandfather, Adlai E. Stevenson I, was William
Jennings Bryan's running mate in the 1900 election.}

% Preface
\preface[2]{ %
The text of this document is of course mainly meant to show how the
template works.  The topic is thus a basic problem which has been solved
in a great number of ways.  This sample topic, which is solving
equations of one variable using iterative techniques, allows us to use
sample equations and figures so that we can see how they will look in
this template.  In addition to this subject, the text also serves as a
very unusual users' manual.  The second chapter, which does not match
the other chapters at all, gives instructions on the actual commands
that are used with this template.}

\abstract{
We show that it is possible to get approximate solutions to
analytically intractable equations using iterative methods.  Thus we
show that the author could pass an undergraduate class in numerical
analysis.  In addition, a unique extension to Brent's method is
proposed that results in slight improvements in convergence.}

\chapter{Introduction}   \label{chap:intro}
The first part.  For example in \ac{CFD}, which gives me a nice
example of an abbreviation to demonstrate, the equation of state
cannot be solved analytically when a perfect gas is not assumed.

And this should at least continue onto a second page.  There are many
texts that have a section on the subject, for instance
\cite{chapra:2002:numerics}.

\chapter{Using This Template}
This chapter is stuck among the others as a brief users' manual for this
template.  The approach to this template is to result in \LaTeX~source
code files (\textit{i.e.}~\tfile{.tex} files) that are as simple as
possible.  It also tries to do as much as possible automatically so that
the user does not have to spend a lot of effort trying to match the
confusing and arbitrary guidelines from Rackham.  This is particularly
useful for the first few pages, for example the title page, dedication,
and abstract page, which are difficult to make in \LaTeX~and are
supposed to go in a certain order.

In addition to the description in this chapter, anyone may, of course,
also look at the source code for this file, \tfile{thesis-sample.tex}.
That file contains all of the source for this \tfile{.pdf} in a single
file, but it will work just as well with multiple input files combined
with the \verb|\input| command.

The final generic comment about this template is that it has been
updated to take advantage of \LaTeX's capabilities to create documents
with links in them.  Provided you are using a modern PDF viewer to view
this document, you may have already noticed this.  It creates a list of
bookmarks, which can be used to quickly navigate what may be a long
document.  It also turns references within the text into links.  The
best examples in this file are the entries in the Table of Contents.
Although the chapter and section names are shown in black (in accordance
with the Rackham guidelines), clicking on them does navigate to the
start of the chapter, section, \textit{etc.}

\section{General Usage}
The way to invoke usage of this template is to put
\begin{code}
\documentclass{thesis-umich.cls}
\end{code}
at the beginning of your preamble.  This can also work if the
\tfile{thesis-umich.cls} file is not in the same directory as your
\tfile{.tex} file.  To do so, just give the relative path.
\begin{code}
\documentclass{./tex/thesis-umich.cls}
\end{code}

Much like a usual article or report in \LaTeX, the user specifies the
primary information about the document in the preamble with commands
like
\begin{code}
\author{Derek J. Dalle}
\chair{James F. Driscoll}
\end{code}
At the beginning of the document, \textit{i.e.}~wherever the user
types \verb|\begin{document}|, the title page will automatically be
created and inserted at the beginning of the document.  If you
forget to declare any of the required fields, it will generate a
title page with a message such as ``Insert an author!''

However, the template does a lot more in the preamble than just create
a title page.  The preamble (that is, whatever comes before
\verb|\begin{document}| in the primary \tfile{.tex} file) is also the
place for the user to specify a dedication, any acknowledgments, a
foreword, \textit{etc.}  This is done in a manner very similar manner
to declaring the author, title, and so on.  Suppose that someone wants
to have a simple dedication ``To Mom'' like the one in the Rackham
guidelines, the following command is all that is needed.
\begin{code}
\dedication{To Mom}
\end{code}
This will cause the document to have a dedication page with the
corresponding text.  If the \verb|\dedication| command is not present,
there will not be a dedication page.  All the work of either having or
not having a dedication has been compressed into a single command!
Things other than simple text \emph{are} allowed in the dedication, so
feel free to put equations or whatever inside there.  There are a few
more commands that can be used to customize the appearance of the
dedication page, and also for the other preamble text pages, but that
is left to Section \ref{ssec:dedication}.


\section{Front Matter}
The \LaTeX term ``frontmatter'' refers to all of the pages that occur
before the beginning of the first chapter.  It is usually made clear
to the reader because the pages in the front matter are numbered with
lower-case Roman numerals instead of Arabic numerals.

The present template, \tfile{thesis-umich.cls} attempts to remove as
much work associated with the front matter as possible.  The template
inserts all of the front matter pages automatically, so that there is
not even a need to use a command like \verb|\maketitle|.  The first
thing after \verb|\begin{document}| should be the start of the first
chapter.

\subsection{Identifiers}
The template is not able to read minds, of course, so there needs to be
some way of inputting the relevant information.  This section covers how
to specify the author, title, and so on.  For the most part, this works
just like any other \LaTeX~document, but a dissertation has a few more
identifiers than most documents (How many books or reports have a
committee?).  So there are a few extra commands provided by this
template, and they work \emph{almost} exactly like the standard
commands.

\begin{table}
 \centering
 \small
 \begin{tabular}{l @{\hspace{16pt}} l @{\hspace{16pt}} p{6cm}}
  \hline \hline
  \textsc{Item} & \textsc{Usage} & \textsc{Comment} \\
  \hline
  Author      & \verb|\author{...}|
   & Works as in standard \LaTeX \\
  Chair       & \verb|\chair{...}|
   & Name of chair \emph{without} any title or affiliation.  This
     appears only on the abstract page, and only if there is no
     co-chair. \\
  Co-chair    & \verb|\cochair{...}|
   & Names of all co-chairs \emph{without} any titles or
     affiliations.  This appears only on the abstract page.  Note
     that by convention, it is not chair \emph{and} co-chair, but
     just two co-chairs. \\
  Committee   & \verb|\committee{...}|
   & Formatted names of committee members \emph{with} the
     appropriate titles and university names.  This will appear
     only on the title page. \\
  Department  & \verb|\department{...}|
   & Title of department of student \\
  Title       & \verb|\title{...}|
   & Works as in standard \LaTeX \\
  Year        & \verb|\year=2012|
   & Year that dissertation will be \emph{completed} \\
  \hline \hline
 \end{tabular}
 \caption{ \label{tab:identifiers}
  List of all identifier commands}
\end{table}

A full list of the identifiers is given in Table \ref{tab:identifiers}.
All of these commands are required except for \verb|\chair| and
\verb|\cochair|.  Those are only used if there is an in-dissertation
abstract page, and in that case only one of the two commands needs to
be used, depending on whether or not you have co-chairs.  If the
\verb|\cochair| command is invoked, the chair will be ignored, and the
co-chairs will be inserted on the abstract page.

The only command that is somewhat unusual to use is the
\verb|\committee| command.  It requires the author to separate the
different committee members manually using line-ending commands.  In
general, this will look something like
\begin{code}
\committee{
 Professor 1 \\
 Professor 2, Other School \\
 Professor 3}
\end{code}
If any of the required fields are not specified, the compilation does
not crash, but rather a reminder message (such as ``Insert a Title!'')
will be placed on the title page in the place of whatever identifier
is missing.

The last comment in this section is on the ability to refer to the
fields of the commands in Table \ref{tab:identifiers} automatically
throughout the text.  This can be done using commands like
\verb|\insertauthor|, \verb|\insertyear|, \textit{etc.}  This is not
Earth-shattering, but it may be convenient if, for example, you are
not sure if you will finish your dissertation in December or January.

\subsection{Text Pages}  \label{ssec:dedication}
The handling of the first few pages after the title page is one of the
best features of this template.

\chapter{Setting}
The second chapter has the good stuff.

\section{Convergence Criteria}
Actually, it might have the worst stuff.  But it is slightly easier to
write than the material in Chapter \ref{chap:intro}.

\newpage

It takes very little text to fill a page in this format, but there is even less text on most of these sample pages.

\section{Why we are doing it}
It is usually a good idea to give reasons for your research.  If you do not, the people who payed you to waist all that time will feel really bad about it, and then they will not provide the same opportunity to future students.

\newpage

I need this page to see what even-numbered pages look like.
